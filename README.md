# Matrix Build Demo (GitHub Actions)

This repository demonstrates a matrix build strategy with artifact management using GitHub Actions.

Each matrix job:
- Runs independently for a different Node.js version
- Generates a unique non-empty build artifact
- Uploads it using `actions/upload-artifact@v4`
- Includes the identifier `matrix-e7852ef` for validation

This setup ensures parallel execution, artifact tracking, and CI/CD pipeline verification.
